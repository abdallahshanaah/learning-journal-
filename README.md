### Mindset
In decision theory and general systems theory, a mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notations held by one or more people or groups of people.[1] A mindset can also be seen as arising out of a person's world view or philosophy of life.[2]

A mindset may be so firmly established that it creates a powerful incentive within these people or groups to continue to adopt or accept prior behaviors, choices, or tools.[citation needed] The latter phenomenon is also sometimes described as mental inertia, "groupthink", and it is often difficult to counteract its effects upon analysis and decision making processes.
